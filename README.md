# SonAR

## An augmented reality instrument for interactive sonification using game audio technologies.
### Sonification of musical chords in circular arrangement using a rotary sequencer.


This mobile application aims to give users an alternative depiction of music theory in form of a circular system as described by Dmitri Tymoczko. Inspired by the work of Kelly Snook my attention was drawn to the methods of sonification and the science community dealing with that topic. The interdisciplinary nature is an immense source for indepth studies of listening, psychology and creativity and can be strongly recommended to those who want to explore meaningful interaction with audio and computational systems.

SonAR uses Unity, Wwise and PureData to utilize complex and powerful technology that is common in the content-heavy projects of the game industry. To provide the control over the sound design that sonification demands methods like programming or visual scripting have to be used. As a concept it could be a decision to limit the designer's workflow to visual scripting so creativity can be more efficient. Some solutions offer good manipulation of audio in realtime but lack the interface for easy visual access. Others do not provide the complexity needed in great projects like games. Therefore the choice was to create a Wwise plugin using enzienaudio's open-source compiler named Heavy so visual patches can be converted into modules for a elobarate audio middleware for fast prototyping.
